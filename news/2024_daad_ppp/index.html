<h1>Funding received from DAAD PPP with University of Glasgow</h1>
<p>A real-world data-driven simulator for interaction-aware autonomous driving benchmarking, funded by DAAD Programmes for Project-Related Personal Exchange (PPP) with Scotland.</p>
<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>As autonomous vehicles (AVs) increasingly operate in mixed traffic environments alongside human road users, ensuring safe and efficient interactions among all road users is becoming critically important. However, developing a socially acceptable interaction-aware autonomous driving (IAAD) system presents significant challenges. These challenges arise from the need for advanced methods to capture human-AV interactions, socially-compliant vehicle control algorithms, and realistic simulators for AV design and testing, all of which depend on extensive real-world data. Addressing these challenges requires a robust cross-disciplinary approach supported by long-term national and international collaborations. To this end, we are applying for the Project-Related Personal Exchange (PPP) program to facilitate a partnership between the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and the University of Glasgow (UofG). This collaboration aims to achieve three key objectives: building a comprehensive real-world dataset using roadside LiDAR, developing models to accurately capture human behaviour to enhance AV decision-making and control, and creating a data-driven simulator for evaluating and advancing socially-compliant autonomous driving technologies. Ultimately, this project will lay the groundwork for a mixed-reality platform that seamlessly integrates real and virtual traffic participants, promoting a truly safe, efficient, and socially-compliant intelligent transportation system.</p>
