      <description>Chen, D., Feng, Y., Li, X., Qu, M., Luo, P., &amp;amp; Meng, L. (2025). Interpreting core forms of urban morphology linked to urban functions with explainable graph neural network. Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 118, 102267.
Abstract Understanding the high-order relationship between urban form and function is essential for modeling the underlying mechanisms of sustainable urban systems. Nevertheless, it is challenging to establish an accurate data representation for complex urban forms that are readily explicable in human terms.</description>

Abstract Excessive exposure to the sun and the resulting heat poses health risks to pedestrians in hot weather. To mitigate these risks, we propose a shadow-oriented navigation system that offers cooler and more convenient walking routes by simulating shadows.</description>

Abstract Recent advances in mobile mapping systems have greatly enhanced the efficiency and convenience of acquiring urban 3D data. These systems utilize LiDAR sensors mounted on vehicles to capture vast cityscapes. However, a significant challenge arises due to occlusions caused by roadside parked vehicles, leading to the loss of scene information, particularly on the roads, sidewalks, curbs, and the lower sections of buildings.</description>

Abstract The idea of â€˜citizen as sensorsâ€™ has gradually become a reality over the past decade. Today, Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) from citizens is highly involved in acquiring information on natural disasters. In particular, the rapid development of deep learning techniques in computer vision and natural language processing in recent years has allowed more information related to natural disasters to be extracted from social media, such as the severity of building damage and flood water levels.</description>

Abstract With increasing urbanization, flooding is a major challenge for many cities today. Based on forecast precipitation, topography, and pipe networks, flood simulations can provide early warnings for areas and buildings at risk of flooding. Basement windows, doors, and underground garage entrances are common places where floodwater can flow into a building.</description>

Abstract With increasing urbanization, in recent years there has been a growing interest and need in monitoring and analyzing urban flood events. Social media, as a new data source, can provide real-time information for flood monitoring. The social media posts with locations are often referred to as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), which can reveal the spatial pattern of such events.</description>
